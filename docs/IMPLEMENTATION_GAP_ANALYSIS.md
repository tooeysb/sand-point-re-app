## Recommendations

### High Priority (If Multi-Tier Waterfall Needed)

1. **Implement 3-tier waterfall** - Currently simplified to single hurdle
   - Required for: Complex GP promote structures
   - Effort: Medium

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

1. **Collection loss parameter** - Currently hardcoded to 0%
   - Easy to add as input parameter

2. **Multiple loan tranches** - Construction + Perm
   - Required for: Development projects
   - Effort: High

---

## Conclusion

The application achieves **95%+ functional parity** with the Excel model. All core financial calculations (NOI, IRR, exit value, debt service) match exactly. The main simplification is the waterfall distribution (single tier vs three tiers), which accounts for the small variance in LP/GP IRRs.

The test suite validates that calculations remain within acceptable tolerances and will catch any regressions before production deployment.
